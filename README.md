# Seoul_Semester_Mosaic
Photo collage project made for my creative coding class in Seoul, Korea.

I took inspiration from the "The World Begins With Every Kiss" mural by Joan Fontcuberta. I had seen it when I had been to Barcelona, Spain. The mural is a mosaic composed of pictures taken by the citizens of Barcelona. Each picture is meant to represent a moment of freedom.
When looking at the mosaic from afar, we can see a kiss between two people and when we get closer we can see the detail of every photo that the mosaic is composed of.

I made my own mosaic in the processing coding language. This mosaic is meant to represent my semester in Seoul, Korea. 
I do so by having a flag of Korea with a tiger (Symbolic animal of Korea) in front of it as the image we can see from afar, and the individual tiles are all pictures I took during my semester abroad.
We can zoom in and out as much as we want to be able to see the image as if we were placed closer or further away from it.
